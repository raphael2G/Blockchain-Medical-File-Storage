# Blockchain-Medical-File-Storage
MediChain is a healthcare solution to storing patient data through universal filing system housed on a dedicated blockchain. 

# Use Case
Imagine you were caught in a surprise accident and required urgent medical attention. After beign rushed to the hospital, life saving treatment begins. Using your liscense, the hospital knows your name, eye colour, organ donor status, and a few more irrelevant details. They know nothing about your allergies, recent surgies, complications, or any other medical details required to treat you. With MediChain, the hospital can utilize your public key whihc is stored on a conviniently located card, or maybe displayed on your Phone's health app. Through your public key, the hospital can access your entire medical history, from allergies and surgies to eye and hair colour. By storing patient data on the blockchain, all patient data is stored in one place. This helps to identify unforseen complications as healthcare personel now have acccess to everything about the patient. 

# Benefits 

## In new hands
Instead of being in the hands of the hospital, patient data is now stored anonymously via the blockchain. 

## Public but anonymous 
As it is stored on the block chain, all data is now publicly available, yet anonymous to the indivudal. This is beneficial as it patient data can only identified with the individual by accessing their public key (similar to social security number). Improved research as all data about all humans can now be utilized for research purposes. A large issue with medical research is the availability and accessibility to data. 


# Status
The current deployment features a proof of concept displayed in the front end. While the block chain is completed on a node environment, it is not yet integrated with the front end.
